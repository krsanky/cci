(slavy)
The simpliest 
test- 1.  squeeze the clutch and tie it there.  put
Your hand on the st.  solenoid.  try to start the bike.  If You
feel the click in the st.  solenoid and nothing elce happens check
for power at the st.  solenoid therminal that is connected to the
st.  motor.  If there is a power- proceed to check at the st.  motor.
If there is not a power- bad st.  solenoid.  If there is a power-
st.  motor.
		 Test 2.  Try to jump between the 2 terminals of
		 the st.  solenoid.  If the bike cranks over - check
		 for a power at the st.  solenoid Y/B wire when
		 pressing the starter button.  If there is a power
		 - check for grownd at the B/W wire of the same
		 connector.  If there is grownd - blame it to the
		 st.  solenoid.

I think Slavy is pretty close here.  That B/W wire is
sort of a switched ground in the system with all the interlocks.
Try to jump the solenoid terminals (the 10 MM nuts) and check to
see if you have 12 Volts on the 2 smaller Y/B and B/W wires when
you hear that click.

However, I'd almost bet a case of beer that you don't have a bad
starter solenoid.  Too much coincidence after just draining the
battery in the park position.  I think something else happened
during the initial "what the hell is wrong" testing Smiley

Also, you mentioned that you jumped it, it idled, and then died
when you tried to drive it.  Did it idle normally or did it idle
rough?

Do you also have a nuetral light on the speedo when you try to start
it?

Do all the lights and horn work?

Since you now have a Jardine you will need at a minimum a 
52.5 & 55 pilot jets and 152.5 & 155 main jets.

The juice(positive) to the starter relay is comming from the Starter Solenoid
Controller.  That's the black box just above the carburator.  The
same box that transmits power to the decompession solenoid.  Suggest
to take the plug off and clean it( and reconnect ofcourse) Greetz
